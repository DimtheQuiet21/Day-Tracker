# Daily Task Tracker by Alan Lee
A repository for a day tracker that helps you organize your day!

## Description

This Day tracker is a useful app that will allow the user to both keep track of the current date and time as well as lay out their daily tasks. This list refreshes at the start of each day and maintains the current daily tasks in the users local data. Moreover, the color coding of the hourly blocks updates with the time, letting the user know what tasks are coming up, and which should have been completed. Also, the current hourly block has a simple dashed bar, to let the user know just how close to a turnover the hour is. 

This current version of my day tracker features several things.
1). A fully functional clock that updates the style of the page at the change of every hour connected to Day JS.
2). An updating current time bar within the current hourly block. 
3). The ability to enter and store data within the hourly blocks.
4). A page reset that occurs at midnight of every day. This will refresh the page at the start of each business day.
